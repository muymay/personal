Personal Resume for Week 5 P33
In the next two weeks – our mentors will work with you to get a resume site built and deployed! Here are some things you can do independently –
# Explore the codepens we’ve shared and play with the code
# Download VSCode
# Define what sections or design you might want to include for your site - It is okay if you don’t have a ton to populate it with for now
# We aim and expect this to be all done by week 5
